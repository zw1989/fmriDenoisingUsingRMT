# fmriDenoisingUsingRMT
This repo includes the code to demonstrate:
- Random matrix theory (RMT) - rmt_demo_forFig1A.m
- RMT based PCA denoising algorithm comparison on a simulated fMRI matrix with and without variance stabilization transformation (VST) used to correct Rician bias in low-SNR magnitude data - ssvd_denoiseTest_forFig4.m
- RMT based PCA denoising on a sample magnitude fMRI data - fmriDenoising_demo.m
